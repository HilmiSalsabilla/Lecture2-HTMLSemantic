            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                One Direction was formed on <strong>July 23, 2010</strong> during the seventh season of the British talent show  <em>The X Factor</em>. Each of the five members — <strong>Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson,</strong> and <strong>Zayn Malik</strong> — originally auditioned as solo contestants. Guest judge <strong>Nicole Scherzinger</strong> suggested they join forces to form a group, an idea that would change pop music forever. Under the mentorship of <strong>Simon Cowell</strong>, One Direction quickly became a fan favorite and finished <strong>third</strong> in the competition, gaining massive attention across the UK.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                After the show, the group signed a record deal with <strong>Syco Music</strong> and released their debut single <em>“What Makes You Beautiful”</em> on <strong>September 11, 2011</strong>. The track topped charts worldwide, paving the way for their first album <em>“Up All Night”</em> (released <strong>November 18, 2011</strong>). The album debuted at number one in multiple countries, making One Direction the first British group to have their debut album enter the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at number one.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                Their success continued with the release of <em>“Take Me Home”</em> on <strong>November 9, 2012</strong>, featuring hit singles like <em>“Live While We’re Young”</em> and <em>“Little Things.”</em> In <strong>2013</strong>, the band released their third album, <em>“Midnight Memories,”</em> which became the <strong>best-selling album of the year</strong> globally. The following year, they dropped <em>“FOUR”</em> on <strong>November 17, 2014</strong>, with memorable tracks such as <em>“Steal My Girl”</em> and <em>“Night Changes.”</em>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                A major change came in <strong>March 2015</strong> when <strong>Zayn Malik</strong> announced his departure from the band. Despite this, the remaining four members continued as a group and released their fifth studio album, <em>“Made in the A.M.”</em>, on <strong>November 13, 2015</strong>, which included hits like <em>“Drag Me Down”</em> and <em>“Perfect.”</em>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                In <strong>January 2016</strong>, One Direction announced an <strong>indefinite hiatus</strong> to allow each member to pursue solo careers. Since then, all five have achieved success individually, each developing their own musical style. Although the band has not officially disbanded, fans continue to celebrate their legacy, influence, and impact on pop culture. From their <em>X Factor</em> beginnings in <strong>2010</strong> to their hiatus in <strong>2016</strong>, One Direction’s story remains one of the most remarkable journeys in modern music history.
